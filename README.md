## System Boot Sequence Initiated...

Welcome, digital renegade! You've stumbled upon **MD2DOC**, a no-nonsense tool forged in the fires of pure text manipulation. Forget the fluff, ditch the distractions. We're here to liberate your markdown and present it in its raw, unadulterated glory.

Think of it as your trusty text decoder ring, translating the cryptic symbols of markdown into clean, readable output. Whether you're a seasoned code warrior or a curious explorer, MD2DOC equips you to extract the essence of your text.

## Core Functionality - Cracking the Code

MD2DOC operates with ruthless efficiency:

* **Text Input Mode:** Paste your markdown directly into the terminal. No file wrangling required.

* **Local Storage Cache:** We respect your time. Recently processed text is cached locally for lightning-fast access.
